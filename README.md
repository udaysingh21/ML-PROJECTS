# ML-PROJECTS


Welcome to ML Projects, a collection of seven machine learning projects showcasing regression and classification models. The projects are written in Python and include Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.

# Projects
The repository includes the following projects:
1. 50_STARTUP
2. DIAMONDS_
3. INSURANCE
4. KC_HOUSEDATA
5. OIL_DATASET
6. PENGUIN
7. PURCHASED

Each project folder contains the code, dataset, and documentation explaining the thought process and approach to solving the problem. The projects demonstrate my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

# Usage
To use these projects, clone the repository and run the Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks. The code is well-documented and includes comments explaining the purpose of each step. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different datasets or machine learning algorithms.

# Working Model
A working model is available for each project at the following links:
